# ST Asset Tacking

This repository contains the ST Asset Tracking app source code.

With the ST Asset Tracking app, you can configure and set-up the threshold of Asset Tracking Sigfox node running the [FP-ATR-SIGFOX1](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32-ode-function-pack-sw/fp-atr-sigfox1.html) firmware package. This package is based on NUCLEO-L053R8 or NUCLEO-L476RG boards, and it supports X-NUCLEO-S2868A1 (built around S2-LP high performance ultra-low power Sub-1GHz RF transceiver) and X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1 (built around BlueNRG-MS very low power BLE4.2 network processor module) for Connectivity, and X-NUCLEO-IKS01A2 for Sensing.

FP-ATR-SIGFOX1 is a firmware package running on STM32 which lets you read data from environmental and motion sensors and send collected data via Sigfox connectivity, moreover Low-energy device geolocation is provided by the Sigfox infrastructure
The app lets you change sampling intervals, choose which sensor data is logged, and the conditions that trigger data logging.
Once configured, using BLE connectivity, the system is starting to track the position, environmental and motion sensors and send it by LPWAN Sigfox service.
